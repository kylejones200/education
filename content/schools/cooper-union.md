[Cooper Union](https://cooper.edu/) in New York City was founded with the idea that higher education should be free. For most of its history, students paid no tuition. In recent years, financial pressures forced the school to introduce tuition, but its leadership remains committed to returning to a tuition-free model. That mission still shapes the culture of the institution. Students at Cooper Union are admitted into highly selective programs in art, architecture, and engineering. The admissions process is rigorous, often involving portfolios, exams, and interviews that measure creativity as well as academic strength.

The academic focus is intense. Engineering students take a demanding series of courses designed to prepare them for professional practice. Architecture at Cooper Union is one of the most respected undergraduate programs in the United States. Despite its location in the middle of New York City, Cooper Union functions more like a traditional campus than many urban schools. Students share studios, workshops, and classrooms concentrated in a small set of buildings, which creates a strong sense of community.
