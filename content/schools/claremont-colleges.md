## Claremont Colleges

The [Claremont Colleges](https://www.claremont.edu/) in Southern California form one of the most distinctive higher education consortia in the United States. Instead of one large university, the consortium consists of several small, highly selective colleges, each with its own character. Students apply to one—[Pomona](https://www.pomona.edu/), [Claremont McKenna](https://www.cmc.edu/), [Harvey Mudd](https://www.hmc.edu/), [Scripps](https://www.scrippscollege.edu/), or [Pitzer](https://www.pitzer.edu/)—but once enrolled, they can take classes across the system.

Academically, this provides remarkable breadth. A Harvey Mudd student focused on engineering can enroll in a Pomona philosophy course. A Claremont McKenna political science major can take a science class at Pitzer. Each college has its own admissions rate, culture, and traditions, but they share libraries, athletic teams, and cross-registration. From the student perspective, the boundaries blur quickly, and life feels like one large community.

Location also plays a role in shaping the experience. The campuses sit together in Claremont, a suburb east of Los Angeles, with palm-lined quads and mountain views. Students benefit from the intimacy of a small residential college but enjoy the resources of a mid-sized university when the consortium is considered as a whole. The biggest difference often comes down to housing: which dorm you live in, which dining hall you frequent, and which student community you identify with most strongly.

For families, the Claremont system offers a compelling alternative to both large universities and isolated liberal arts colleges. Students gain choice, flexibility, and access, but also retain the mentorship and attention of a small-college environment.
