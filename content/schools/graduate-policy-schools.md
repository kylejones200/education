Choosing a graduate school in public policy or international affairs is not simple. Each program has its strengths and weaknesses, and much depends on what a student values: academic rigor, professional networking, financial aid, or location. Here are impressions of some of the leading schools, drawn from firsthand experience and conversations with friends and colleagues.

### [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/)

The Kennedy School carries prestige, but it comes with tradeoffs. Its first year is heavy on core requirements, more so than most peers. Students spend much of that year in large lecture halls with 50 to 100 classmates. Not every professor excels at teaching, and not every student stands out as a star. But the payoff is exposure to a remarkable mix of people and ideas. High-profile visitors are a regular occurrence. During my two years, I saw at least ten heads of state. The network and the global connections make the Kennedy School hard to match, even if the day-to-day classroom experience can feel uneven.

### [Columbia SIPA](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/)

Friends who studied at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs often expressed disappointment. SIPA benefits from its New York City location, which offers energy and opportunity for those who thrive in that environment. Yet the program itself struggles to balance its identity. It sits between public policy and international relations, never fully committing to either. The joint degree with the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) is a strong option. One year at SIPA and one at LSE produces two degrees and a more rounded experience.

### [Yale Jackson School](https://jackson.yale.edu/)

Yale’s international relations program is small and highly academic. Students work closely with professors, which creates an intimate intellectual environment. The program emphasizes scholarship over practice. Few courses touch practical skills like budgeting, but nearly all require significant writing. It is not uncommon for students to produce 200 pages of research papers in a single semester. For those who want intellectual rigor and a close-knit academic culture, Yale is a good fit.

### [Fletcher School at Tufts](https://fletcher.tufts.edu/)

Fletcher is widely regarded as the best international relations school in the country. Its alumni network, sometimes referred to as the “Fletcher Mafia,” is active and loyal. Students can choose a mix of practical or theoretical classes, tailoring their experience to their goals. Fletcher also requires proficiency in a second language, tested before graduation, which strengthens its international profile. Its MALD program serves as a foundation for those who want to continue to a PhD. For students who want both flexibility and a strong professional network, Fletcher shines.

### Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School (now [SPIA](https://spia.princeton.edu/))

The standout feature of Princeton’s program is funding. Every student receives full financial support: tuition, room, board, books, and even some travel. Cohorts are small, usually around sixty students, which fosters tight connections. Students choose one of four tracks—development, international relations, domestic politics, or quantitative analysis. The curriculum resembles the Kennedy School’s core, but the financial package and the group capstone project, which often includes travel, set it apart.

### [Georgetown Walsh School](https://sfs.georgetown.edu/)

Georgetown offers a respected program with strong placement in Washington, D.C. Its Walsh School of Foreign Service benefits from the location and the university’s reputation. At the same time, the culture can feel status-conscious. Students often compare themselves to peers at nearby [American University (SIS)](https://www.american.edu/sis/), [George Washington (Elliott School)](https://elliott.gwu.edu/), and [Johns Hopkins SAIS](https://sais.jhu.edu/). Interaction with students in Georgetown’s law or business schools tends to be limited. Still, the network and proximity to policymakers make it a strong choice for many.

### [Johns Hopkins SAIS](https://sais.jhu.edu/)

SAIS has a well-earned reputation as the top international relations school in Washington, D.C., despite occasional rival claims from Georgetown. Every student specializes in international economics alongside another field, such as Middle East studies. The Bologna, Italy campus adds another dimension. Students can spend their first year there and their second in D.C., blending European and American perspectives. For students considering a PhD, SAIS provides strong preparation.

### [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/)

Chicago offers a one-year master’s program in international relations, an appealing option for those who want to move quickly. Joint programs with the [Harris School](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) emphasize quantitative approaches, reflecting the university’s broader intellectual culture. Students interested in data and analysis will find the environment rewarding.

### [Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/)

The Monterey Institute specializes in security studies, particularly non-proliferation. It attracts students passionate about nuclear policy, arms control, and related fields. Its California location is stunning, which adds to its appeal. For students who want to focus narrowly on security and international studies in a dedicated setting, Monterey delivers.

**Final Thoughts**
No single program is best for everyone. The Kennedy School offers scale and global reach. Yale provides intimacy and academic intensity. Fletcher and SAIS deliver networks that open doors worldwide. Princeton offers financial freedom. The choice depends on a student’s goals, finances, and preferred balance between theory and practice. What matters most is finding a program that matches not only your résumé, but also your vision of what you want your career to be.
