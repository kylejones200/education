The U.S. service academies—[West Point](https://www.westpoint.edu/) (United States Military Academy), the [Naval Academy](https://www.usna.edu/), the [Air Force Academy](https://www.usafa.edu/), the [Coast Guard Academy](https://www.uscga.edu/), and the [Merchant Marine Academy](https://www.usmma.edu/)—offer some of the most selective and distinctive college experiences in the country. Admission requires more than high test scores. Each candidate must secure a nomination from a U.S. senator, a representative, or in some cases the Vice President. These nominations are competitive and often involve their own applications, interviews, or evaluations. Students who hope to attend must begin preparing early in high school.

Physical fitness is also a requirement. Each applicant must pass a fitness test measuring strength, speed, and endurance. Training for this test takes time, which means students should build habits of exercise and conditioning well before senior year. Strong academics and leadership in extracurricular activities round out the profile. Admissions officers at the academies look for students who combine discipline, resilience, and a commitment to service.

The reward for meeting these high standards is significant. Service academy students receive a full scholarship covering tuition, room, and board. In exchange, they commit to military service after graduation. Life at an academy is rigorous and regimented, blending academics with military training. For students who want to serve and who thrive under structure and challenge, the academies provide an unparalleled education and pathway to leadership.
