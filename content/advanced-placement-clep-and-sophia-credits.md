Many students assume they must wait until May to take Advanced Placement (AP) exams. In reality, credit can come from multiple sources and at different times. CLEP exams, for example, allow students to test out of introductory courses year-round. Online platforms such as Sophia.org offer self-paced courses in dozens of subjects, and completion can translate into transferable credit at many universities.

Sophia currently covers around eighty lower-division subjects. Some students complete multiple courses in a single month, taking advantage of the flexibility. Learn.org provides another route, sometimes offering credit at the upper-division level. These options can save time and money, particularly at institutions that are generous in awarding transfer credit.

The challenge lies in transferability. Local and regional universities often accept a wide range of credits. More selective colleges typically want students to take courses with their own faculty, which means they may deny or limit outside credit. Families must check each target schoolâ€™s policies carefully. Done thoughtfully, however, alternative credit can accelerate progress toward a degree, reduce costs, and give students confidence as they enter college-level work.
