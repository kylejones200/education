Internships are an essential part of preparing for college and careers, but many students assume they must live in Washington, D.C., New York, or another major city to gain access. Virtual internships change that equation. Today, organizations such as the [Smithsonian](https://www.si.edu/) offer remote [internship opportunities](https://intern.si.edu/) that allow high school and college students to participate from anywhere.

What students actually do in a virtual internship varies. At the Smithsonian, for example, interns may help organize digital collections, contribute to online exhibitions, or support research projects. Other organizations might assign policy research, data analysis, or communications tasks. While not every project carries the prestige of walking through a famous museum each morning, the skills developed are real: time management, communication with supervisors, and the ability to contribute to professional work without face-to-face oversight.

The flexibility makes these opportunities accessible to students whose families cannot relocate for the summer. A student in a small town can gain exposure to national institutions and list “Smithsonian internship” on their résumé, which sends a strong signal to admissions officers. Virtual internships also prepare students for the realities of modern work, where remote collaboration and digital tools are increasingly the norm. They may not replace in-person experiences entirely, but they expand access and open doors for students across the country.
