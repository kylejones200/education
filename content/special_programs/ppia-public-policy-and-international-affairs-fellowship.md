For students interested in government, international affairs, or public service, the [Public Policy and International Affairs (PPIA) Fellowship](https://www.ppiaprogram.org/) provides a pathway into graduate study. This program selects rising juniors from across the country and immerses them in an intensive summer of policy training. Host campuses include [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/), the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), and [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

The curriculum mirrors what first-year masterâ€™s students encounter at leading schools of public policy. Participants take graduate-level coursework in statistics, economics, and policy analysis. They also work on real projects, applying theory to pressing issues such as healthcare reform or environmental regulation. The program is free for accepted students, removing financial barriers and broadening access to policy education.

The goal is not only academic preparation but also exposure. Many students enter the fellowship unsure whether they belong in a policy school environment. By the end of the summer, they have tested themselves in graduate seminars, built a network of peers and mentors, and seen firsthand what a policy career might involve. Admissions officers at top policy schools know the program well, and PPIA alumni often have an edge in graduate admissions. For undergraduates with even a spark of interest in public service, applying to PPIA can be transformative.
