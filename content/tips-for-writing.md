Students have to produce written deliverables like essays, case analyses, and reports. While the technical content is important, the quality of our writing can make a big difference in how effectively we communicate our ideas.

In a recent class, the instructor shared some valuable writing tips that can help elevate our written work. Let's dive into the key insights:

- Get to the Point: When writing for a professional audience, we don't need to use fancy, complex language. In fact, the simpler and more direct our writing, the better. Avoid overly formal or "Latinized" words in favor of plain, straightforward language. The goal is to convey your ideas clearly, not to impress with your vocabulary. Keep your sentences short and concise.
- Incorporate Data: Use data to support our points. Whether it's financial figures, project metrics, or other relevant statistics, incorporating quantitative information can make our arguments more compelling and well-rounded. Present the data clearly and tie it back to your key points.
- Be Bold and Opinionated: New writers tend to hedge their statements. Instead, be clear on what you think. Take a stand and make your perspectives clear. You are being paid for your opinion. Share it confidently (and back it up with data).
- Check Your Readability: Make it easy to read. Use readability tools like the Hemingway App and Grammarly. These will analyze the grade level and complexity of our text and provide suggestions for simplifying sentences and improving flow. The Flesch-Kincaid readability score is built into MS Word and corresponds your text to a U.S. grade school level. Aim for a 6–8 grade reading level—the sweet spot for most professional communications.

By keeping these tips in mind, we can elevate the quality of our written work and communicate our project management insights more effectively. The next time you sit down to draft a case analysis or report, remember to be direct, data-driven, bold, and easy to read. Good luck!
