Public speaking feels intimidating to many students. The best way to grow is through practice. Rehearse in safe settings such as a debate club, a class presentation, or a mock interview. Record yourself and watch for clarity, pace, and presence.

Structure your talk clearly. Begin with an introduction, build through the main points, and end with a firm conclusion. Limit yourself to one or two central ideas so the audience stays with you.

Learn to respond to questions with composure. Share stories that illustrate your points. With repetition, nerves give way to poise.
