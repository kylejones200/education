Effective communication has three dimensions. The first is the message—the core idea you want to share. The second is delivery—the style, tone, and medium. The third is follow-up—the way you reinforce the message over time.

A student writing a personal statement may focus on resilience. That theme can reappear in an interview and again in a recommendation letter. Consistency across settings makes the message stronger and more memorable.

Linking what you say, how you say it, and how you sustain it creates communication that lasts.
