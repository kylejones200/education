Many students underestimate the importance of rewriting. They draft an essay, polish the grammar, and submit it. Admissions officers, however, can tell the difference between a first draft and a thoughtful, reworked piece. Strong essays usually emerge only after two or three complete rewrites. The process takes time, but it is the clearest path to an authentic and polished result.

When approaching the essay, students should begin by writing freely. The first draft should capture ideas without worrying about structure. That draft is then set aside. On the second attempt, students focus on clarity and flow, trimming unnecessary words and sharpening the point. A third draft should polish details, strengthen transitions, and ensure the essay reflects the applicant’s voice. At each stage, the student gets closer to an essay that is both personal and professional.

Admissions offices often say they want students to be “clear about what they want to do and how they will affect the world.” That demand can feel unfair, since most teenagers change their minds about majors and careers. The essay, however, is not about predicting the future. It is about showing thoughtfulness and self-awareness. A student who admits uncertainty but explains what excites them and why will often write a stronger essay than one who makes exaggerated claims of destiny. The key is authenticity, and authenticity requires time, revision, and reflection.
