Strong communicators start with the audience. Who are you addressing? What do they know already? What do they expect from you?

Admissions officers read thousands of essays each year. They look for genuine voice, not inflated language. Professors expect depth and clarity. Recruiters value confidence and focus.

One framework divides audiences into four groups: supportive, neutral, skeptical, and resistant. Each group requires a different emphasis. Supportive listeners respond to affirmation. Neutral ones want clarity. Skeptical audiences want evidence. Resistant audiences expect respect.

When you understand your audience, your words land with greater impact.
