When families first start looking at colleges, they often turn to rankings or glossy brochures. Those resources provide some useful information, but they miss what really matters: the lived experience of students and the fit for each individual. My own journey into this work began after reading Loren Pope’s book *Colleges That Change Lives*. The book highlighted smaller schools that shaped students in transformative ways. I looked for a more recent version and found there wasn’t one, so I began doing my own research.

Websites like Niche.com are helpful for data. They track admissions scores, acceptance rates, and student reviews. But numbers don’t tell the whole story. Two schools may both admit students with similar SAT scores but provide radically different experiences once students arrive. One may emphasize research and faculty mentorship; another may prioritize pre-professional programs and networking. What matters is not only whether a student can get in, but also whether they will thrive once there.

The real value of research lies in asking deeper questions: What do alumni say about the community? What unique traditions shape student life? How does the school support students who change majors? Those are the elements that rarely appear in rankings but determine whether a student feels at home. My goal is to help families ask those questions and find the schools where students can succeed, grow, and graduate ready for their next step.
