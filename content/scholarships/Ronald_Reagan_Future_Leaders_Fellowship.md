The [Reagan Fellowship](http://www.thephillipsfoundation.org/futureleaders.htm), sponsored by the Phillips Foundation, is less about learning policy mechanics and more about building ideological firepower. It supports sophomores and juniors who show leadership potential and an interest in conservative thought. Instead of interning in the State Department, you may find yourself writing policy papers, attending seminars, or rubbing elbows with opinion makers in Washington.

The target group here is undergraduates who lean right of center and want to deepen their engagement with policy debates. If you‚Äôve ever been the student in class pushing back on Keynesian economics or defending limited government, this fellowship will feel like home.

Pursuing it means a competitive application process in your sophomore or junior year. Strong essays, leadership roles, and a track record of engagement with conservative policy matter. If chosen, you‚Äôll get stipends for projects, access to senior mentors, and opportunities to publish. Think of it as being handed the microphone at a crowded debate.
