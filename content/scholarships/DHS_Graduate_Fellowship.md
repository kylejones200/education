If the Rising Juniors program is the appetizer, the [DHS Graduate Fellowship](http://www.orau.gov/dhsed/04grad.htm) is the main course. Sponsored again by Homeland Security, it supports seniors heading into graduate school or students already in their first year of grad studies. This one isnâ€™t a tasteâ€”itâ€™s a meal ticket for an advanced education in areas DHS cares about.

The target here is soon-to-be or new graduate students focused on things like public policy, cybersecurity, disaster management, or critical infrastructure. If youâ€™re the type who spends Friday nights reading FEMA after-action reports or coding simulations of port security, DHS would like to meet you.

Pursuing it means applying as a senior or in your first year of grad school. The fellowship covers tuition, pays a stipend, and provides internships within DHS. You get financial support plus the kind of insider access that makes your rÃ©sumÃ© pop. Think of it as a season pass to the world of security and emergency management.
