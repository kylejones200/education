The [Undergraduate Fellowship on Terrorism](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/programs/programs.htm) is sponsored by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. Donâ€™t let the heavy name scare youâ€”itâ€™s an opportunity for undergrads to dive into the policy world of terrorism and national security. The fellowship combines seminars, research, and internships, putting students face-to-face with experts who work on todayâ€™s global conflicts.

The target group is sophomores, juniors, and seniors who want to understand terrorism beyond the headlines. International relations majors, aspiring journalists, or anyone curious about the nuts and bolts of counterterrorism strategy will find it rewarding. You donâ€™t need to be an expert in Arabic or military historyâ€”interest and commitment are what theyâ€™re after.

Pursuing it means applying during your undergrad years with a strong essay and rÃ©sumÃ©. If accepted, youâ€™ll take part in programs that blend classroom learning with practical policy exposure. The program isnâ€™t about glorifying conflictâ€”itâ€™s about analyzing, debating, and understanding. Imagine returning from a summer in Washington and being able to explain, with authority, the policy complexities behind last weekâ€™s news headline.
