The [J.W. Saxe Prize](http://www.jwsaxefund.org/home.html) is a small but mighty award. It helps cover expenses for unpaid internships in public service. Picture this: you land your dream internship in D.C., but it doesn’t pay. Instead of working double shifts at Starbucks to cover rent, the Saxe Prize helps fund your summer so you can focus on the work that matters.

The target here is anyone headed into public service internships—whether in government, NGOs, or nonprofits. If you’re passionate about public interest but held back by the reality of unpaid work, this fellowship exists to bridge that gap.

Pursuing it means applying before your internship begins. You’ll need to show commitment to public service, details about your internship, and a clear explanation of your financial need. If chosen, you get a stipend that makes the experience possible. Think of it as a kind-hearted traveler slipping you some cash so you can stay on the road a little longer.
