The [IIPP Fellowship](http://www.uncfsp.org/iipp) is the United Negro College Fund‚Äôs way of saying: America needs more diverse voices in international affairs. Sponsored by the UNCF Special Programs Corporation, it‚Äôs a long-term investment in sophomores who want to tackle global challenges. Instead of a single summer, it strings together training, mentoring, internships, and study abroad over several years.

The target is clear: sophomores from underrepresented communities who are serious about international service. If you‚Äôve grown up in one place but can imagine yourself negotiating trade in Geneva or managing development projects in Ghana, IIPP sees that potential. They want students who are resilient, curious, and open to new perspectives.

Pursuing IIPP is a commitment. You apply sophomore year and, if chosen, you‚Äôre in for the long haul: summer institutes, language training, overseas study, and a network of alumni working in embassies and NGOs. Think of it as buying a Eurail pass that doesn‚Äôt expire for four years‚Äîit takes you across continents, introduces you to other travelers, and sets you up for a career where the passport never gathers dust.
