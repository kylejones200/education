The [Pickering Fellowships](http://www.woodrow.org/public-policy/description_of_service.html) are the express train into the U.S. Foreign Service. Sponsored by the State Department and the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, they come in two flavors: the undergraduate fellowship (apply sophomore year) and the graduate fellowship (apply senior year). Both cover tuition, provide internships, and guarantee a spot in the State Department once you finish your degree. In other words, you‚Äôre not just applying for a fellowship‚Äîyou‚Äôre applying for a career.

The target is students who want to become U.S. diplomats. You don‚Äôt need to already know five languages or own a collection of embassy cocktail dresses, but you do need a strong interest in international affairs, public service, and representing your country abroad. Pickering especially seeks applicants from diverse backgrounds, aiming to make the Foreign Service look more like the America it represents.

Pursuing Pickering takes stamina. You‚Äôll need a sharp application, strong recommendations, and a clear explanation of why you want to spend your life troubleshooting in embassies from Manila to Mogadishu. The prize is huge: tuition support, paid internships in Washington and abroad, and a guaranteed job as a Foreign Service Officer. It‚Äôs like getting a golden key to the diplomatic world, minus the jet lag (at least until training ends).
