The [DHS Rising Juniors Fellowship](http://www.orau.gov/dhsed/04ugrad.htm), sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, is for students who like to mix policy with problem-solving. Think of it as a summer abroad program, except instead of sipping espresso in Rome, you‚Äôll be analyzing threats, resilience, and national security challenges in Washington. The program gives sophomores a front-row seat to the machinery of government security.

The target audience is sophomores who are curious about security policy. If you‚Äôve ever wondered who decides which liquids you can bring on a plane or how to balance privacy with surveillance, this program puts you right in the conversation. It‚Äôs not limited to political science majors. Engineers, computer scientists, and social scientists all fit‚Äîbasically, anyone who can apply their field to keeping the country running safely.

Pursuing it means applying sophomore year. You‚Äôll need transcripts, recommendations, and a clear case for why you want to spend your summer working on DHS projects. The experience adds real-world credibility and can lead to further internships and jobs. Imagine returning to campus in the fall and explaining that your summer involved national resilience strategies instead of mowing lawns.
