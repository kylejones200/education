This isnâ€™t a fellowship in itselfâ€”itâ€™s the Lonely Planet guidebook for finding them. Hosted by [Idealist.orgâ€™s Fellowship and Scholarship Clearinghouse](http://www.idealist.org/career/fellowship.html), itâ€™s a database of fellowships and scholarships in public service. Instead of wandering aimlessly, you can search and compare opportunities, deadlines, and requirements in one place.

The target is broad: students, recent graduates, or mid-career professionals. If youâ€™re hunting for your next step in policy or international affairs, this clearinghouse is the place to start.

Pursuing it is straightforward: go to the site, browse, and bookmark. Youâ€™ll find listings you didnâ€™t know existed. Some are niche, some are broad, but all are designed to help you move forward in public service. Think of it as the Eurail map: lots of lines, and your job is to pick which train to catch.
