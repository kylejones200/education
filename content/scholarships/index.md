title: Fellowships for Students of Public Policy and International Relations

Introduction to Fellowships in Public Policy and International Relations

Fellowships are the Eurail passes of a public policy career. They open doors, let you cover more ground, and connect you with fellow travelers headed in the same direction. Where scholarships mostly pay tuition, fellowships often add structure: summer institutes, mentoring, internships, and a network that sticks with you long after graduation. If scholarships are like free meals on the road, fellowships are like finding a host family that also teaches you how to cook.

The targets are students who care about the world beyond their own backyard. Public policy and international relations fellowships attract folks who dream of working at the UN, the State Department, a think tank, or city hall. They want curiosity, leadership, and commitment. You don’t need to have the whole world figured out—you just need to show you’ll put your ticket to good use.

Applications are competitive. Deadlines sneak up early. Essays and recommendations matter. And yes, some applications will make you feel like you’re filling out a visa form for a small country that no longer exists. But once you’re in, these fellowships change your path. They give you confidence, skills, and contacts. Think of them as a backpack full of opportunities you didn’t know you could carry.
