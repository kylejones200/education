The [PPIA Fellowship](http://www.ppiaprogram.org) is like a summer boot camp for policy nerds. Supported by APPAM, APSIA, and NASPAA (all acronyms that sound scarier than they are), itâ€™s designed to prepare undergraduates for graduate school in public policy and international affairs. Itâ€™s not just about moneyâ€”itâ€™s about exposure. Youâ€™ll spend the summer at a top policy school, surrounded by faculty and peers who speak the same language of budgets, diplomacy, and statistics.

The target group here is rising seniors (apply junior year). The program particularly welcomes students from underrepresented backgrounds, but anyone with a demonstrated interest in public service is eligible. If youâ€™ve spent your free time working on campaigns, writing about climate policy, or helping your city council untangle housing ordinances, youâ€™re the type they want.

Pursuing PPIA means blocking out a summer to dive deep. Youâ€™ll apply in your junior year with essays, transcripts, and recommendations. If selected, youâ€™ll gain a stipend, GRE prep, and the kind of contacts who later become professors, supervisors, or travel buddies at conferences. The best part? Many graduate schools partner with PPIA to offer reduced or even full tuition for alumni. Think of it as a loyalty card for grad school.
