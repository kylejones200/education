## Gap Years and Deferrals

An admissions officer at Princeton once explained that his top advice for students was simple: defer. Take a year between high school and college to gain experiences, learn about yourself, and build perspective. Colleges increasingly recognize the value of gap years. They understand that students who arrive after meaningful experiences—whether travel, service, work, or study abroad—often contribute more to the classroom and the community.

A gap year is not a year off; it is a year on a different track. Some students work to save money, gaining independence and maturity. Others travel, volunteer, or join structured programs abroad. The common theme is that they return with stories, insights, and resilience that enrich their college years. Admissions officers know this, which is why many encourage students to apply, gain admission, and then request a deferral.

Families sometimes worry that a gap year will derail momentum or make students less likely to enroll. Research shows the opposite. Students who take gap years often arrive more focused, more motivated, and better prepared for the challenges of higher education. For the right student, a gap year can be the single most transformative choice in the entire college journey.
