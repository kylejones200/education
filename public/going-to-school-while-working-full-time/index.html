      <div class="content"><p>Going to school while working full time</p>
<p>Many employers provide the opportunity to continue my education with support from the company.  I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I&rsquo;ve always loved school and had been dreaming of returning to school from the day after my graduation.</p>
<p>I started an online degree program in 2015 and learned the hard way some of the limitations that come with this business.  I&rsquo;m not in HR and I can&rsquo;t speak for them but I wanted to share my experience in hope that you can avoid some of my mistakes.</p>
<p>There is a crazy variety of degree options for online education now.  It is more than University of Phoenix and Western Governor&rsquo;s University.  Want a PhD in <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/elearning/doctoral/systems-engineering/">systems engineering</a>, go to Texas Tech.  Is <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/english/tcr/PHDTCR/default.php">communication</a> more your speed, Tech offers an online PhD in that too.  How about an ivy league credential like a masters from <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/admissions/degree-programs/online-mph-in-epidemiology/">Harvard</a> or a technical degree from <a href="http://online.purdue.edu/online-programs/masters-degrees">Purdue</a>, <a href="http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/school-of-information-systems-and-management/information-technology-msit/distance/index.aspx">Carnegie Mellon</a> or <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/masters/online-ms-cs">Georgia Tech</a>?  </p>
<p>Here are a few things to consider when thinking about going back to school:</p>
<p>It is hard. You give up time with your family and friends to attend class and study. There is the stress of performing well at both work and school.  On the one hand, it is graduate school and grades don&rsquo;t matter that much.  On the other hand, you wouldn&rsquo;t be voluntarily going back to school if you weren&rsquo;t an overachiever.</p>
<p>For many emplpoyers, you have to pay upfront and the company pays you back.  This is the compay&rsquo;s way of making sure you are committed and actually complete the courses.  The downside is that you need enough cash to pay tuition and then not see that money again for several months.  My tuition was $8,100 a semester and it hurt to go without that until the reimbursement came back. Critical point here &ndash; your classes have to be pre-approved or you don&rsquo;t get reimbursed.  Yeah, that was an expensive mistake.</p>
<p>You can only take two online classes per semester. There are several good options for school in Houston including MBAs at <a href="http://weekends.tulane.edu/MBA">Tulane</a>, <a href="http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/mba/houston">UTexas</a> and <a href="http://mays.tamu.edu/citycentre/">Texas A&amp;M</a>. If you want to pursue a program that is not in Houston, the options for online learning have really increased.  Better and better schools offer online degrees which are equivalent to their on-campus programs.  You can get a masters from <a href="http://scpd.stanford.edu/programs/masters-degrees">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://cvn.columbia.edu/">Columbia</a>, <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/online">NYU</a> or <a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a> without leaving Houston.  But if you go online, you can only take two classes a semester.  And you definitely give up some of the benefits of graduate school by doing a degree online.</p>
<p>You have to stay for one year after the last payment.  The company expects to benefit from paying for your degree.  So when you take the company&rsquo;s money, you agree that you will work here for at least another year.  </p>
<p>Business programs have special conditions.  MBAs or any of a broad array of related programs (finance, economics, marketing, communication, engineering management, and more) come with a reimbursement cap of $20k.  That may seem like a lot but at most schools, the business programs cost more.  UNC has the highest ranked online MBA and tuition costs $60k per year, a lot more than the cap.  A masters in operations research at Columbia will cost $30,370 a year and you will have to cover the $10,370.   </p>
<p>The second caveat of business programs is that the reimbursement is taxable. So you don&rsquo;t recover the full $20k.  Technical degrees are considered a working condition fridge benefit and are not taxed.</p>
<p>Conclusion: is it worth it? Ultimately this is a personal choice.  The company is not going to pay you more because you earned a degree.  But the degree could open up new opportunities at the company and beyond.  I still have a year left in my program, but I&rsquo;m already thinking about what program I could pursue next.</p>
